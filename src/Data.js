We use publicly available information to make our decisions. A mix of information from the brand and from trusted third parties.

We think transparency is the most important first step. We look at what they share publicly about their supply chain, internal policies, material usage, and their social and environmental impact. If we can’t find anything about their approach to sustainability — it’s usually quite a telling sign.`,

The commission varies between brands. But usually around 5–15% of the sale amount. Affiliate links cover some of our running costs and help us to make Good Garms better.`,
